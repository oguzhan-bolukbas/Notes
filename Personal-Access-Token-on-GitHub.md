1. For Windows OS

    Go to Credential Manager from Control Panel => Windows Credentials => find git:<https://github.com> => Edit => On Password replace with with your GitHub Personal Access Token => You are Done

Type Keychain access then press the Enter key to launch the app => In Keychain Access, search for github.com => Find the internet password entry for github.com => Edit or delete the entry accordingly => You are done

3. For a Linux-based OS

    For Linux, you need to configure the local GIT client with a username and email address,

    ```git config --global user.name "your_github_username"```

    ```git config --global user.email "your_github_email"```

    ```git config -l```

    Once GIT is configured, we can begin using it to access GitHub. Example:

    ```git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```

        > Cloning into `YOUR-REPOSITORY`...
        Username: <type your username>
        Password: <type your password or personal access token (GitHub)

    Now cache the given record in your computer to remembers the token:

    ```git config --global credential.helper cache```

    If needed, anytime you can delete the cache record by:

    ```git config --global --unset credential.helper```

    ```git config --system --unset credential.helper```

    Now try to pull with -v to verify

    ```git pull -v```

    Linux/Debian (Clone as follows):

    ```git clone https://<tokenhere>@github.com/<user>/<repo>.git```

4. For PhpStorm

    If you are using PhpStorm, go to menu Git => pull and select authentication via Personal Access Token. Enter your PAT it will allow you to pull/push the changes.
